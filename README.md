# WeatherApplication

This application presents a simple weather forecast for the current day and the next two days. With the weather changing every hour.
Using the search button, you can find the city you need and find out the weather if you do not want to turn on the GPS.
On the opposite side of the search there is a button that will return you to the original screen and show the city at your location.
More details can be seen in the video, in which I tried to show all the available functions of this application.
